## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app or any additional context you'd like to add.
* I had some issues with manually implementing the popup modal for the user to confirm deletion, but found that there was the react-confirm-alert library that could be used for that task.
* I also had some issues with styling of the front page to get the gradient effect, but also got that figured out eventually as well.
* I also had some issues with keeping track of which props to pass down to which components.
